Processing 


Max/MSP options: open .maxpat or copy the text file into empty patcher window. May run in "lock" mode with Max/MSP runtime. You may edit patch with the full version of Max/MSP. Add sounds for a good time. 

Arduino: upload code to Arduino board of your choosing. No extra circuitry involved. Have fun!

Processing: for the console-only viewing party.
